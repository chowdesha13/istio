# This file will be fetched and ran using: curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -
# so it should be pure bourne shell, not bash (and not reference other scripts)

# ***NOTE:*** THIS FILE WILL FETCH THE LATEST SEMANTICLY RELEASED VERSION
# This file is referenced by the getLatestIstio link but is named
# downloadIstioCandidate.sh. This is inconsistent. The file will match
# the short link anticipated behavior.

# The script fetches the latest Istio release semantically and untars it.
# Any pre-release or build metadata versions (containing a - or +) are ignored.
# Users can specify an Istio version to change the fetched version
#    curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.2.6 sh -
